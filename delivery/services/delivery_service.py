        This method will attempt to deliver all runfolders for the specified project.

        Since the process is somewhat involved, here's a explanation of what's going on and why.

        First, there are three modes of delivery which needs to be handled. CLEAN, which denotes
        that this project is not allowed to be delivered previously. BATCH, which will deliver any
        runfolders which have not previously been delivered. And finally, FORCE, which will deliver
        all the runfolders regardless of their previous status.

        Two steps are then required to enable the staging, that require some explanation.
        Reading the code you will note that the _get_projects_to_deliver will create a
        DeliverySource and then a new DeliverySource will be created by this method. The reason
        for this is that since we create a intermediate directory in which links to all the
        runfolders which are to be delivered together are created. This directory is then passed
        as a DeliverySource when creating a new StagingOrder (which is goes on to be staged).
